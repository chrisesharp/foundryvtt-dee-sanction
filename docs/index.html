          <p>When you have created a world and enter it for the first time, you will be
            presented with a dialog asking you to import all the content from the compendia
            that come with the system. You should really do this, as the system will
            not work as designed without the base content in place.

          <p>When you import, this dialog will not be shown again, unless you go into settings
            to untick the <em>Initialized</em> setting.
          </p>
          <p>If something goes wrong, or you're upgrading,it's advisable to <em>Delete All</em>. 
            This will remove all compendia content as if you've just installed. You will need to
            import after this.
          </p>
          <p>If you click <em>Don't show this again</em>, it will not import, and tick this setting
          without importing...this is not advisable, but you are the master of your own destiny...

        <p>The System settings are to control system-wide behaviours, and you

                <ul>
                The Dee Sanction system needs to import all of the compendium content when a world is first created.
                This is because there are a number of "container"-like items that need to be able to find and 
                resolve their named references to behave correctly. When you load the world for the first time,
                you will be presented with a dialog asking you to import the content, or not to show this dialog
                again in the future. By unticking this option, you will re-enable the prompting to import.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Reveal effect editing</strong>
                <ul>
                The Dee Sanction system uses the Foundry VTT <em>Active Effects</em> to model the game mechanics
                of <em>Consequences</em> but it's possible to add effects directly to characters and any items.
                This can enable you to create your own custom effects. In the future, I'll wrap a more user-friendly
                interface over this like I've done with Consequences, but for now, you can get to these effects by
                ticking this box. It will add a new tab (for the GM) to character and item sheets.
                <p>For <em>advanced users only!</em></p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>The top of the character sheet header contains text fields 
            you can edit directly for the agent's name, home and mannerism.
          </p>
          <p>The current tradecraft for the agent (as chosen by the group) can be selected using the drop-down.</p>
          <p>The agent's current occupation will be automatically displayed here when set (see below)

          <hr>
          <h4 class="docs-header" id="resources">Resources</h4>
          <p>The default tab covers the basic resources of the character.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/agent-resources.png" />
          </p>
          <p>The three resources are in three columns at the top.</p>
          <p>They each start with the default d6 die, and you can alter them using the up and down icons.</p>
          <p>
            To roll a challenge using one of the resources, click on the die icon. The die presented in the dialog
            that pops up takes into account any step-downs you may have accrued from any lingering consequences,
            and the potency and/or consequences of an enemy you are currently targeting.
          </p>
          <p>On the second row there is an Injuries field where you record your current Hits, with two
            tick boxes to record any falters accrued whilst at zero Hits.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/consequences.png" />
          </p>
          <p>Next to this is a space to collect consequences, in the event of any falters. These can be dragged from
            the consequences folder under Items, or from the chat dialog if one is presented as a result of a roll.

          </p>
          <p>
            The first row contains any <em>Abilities</em> the agent has. These can be dragged from the Abilities folder.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to create a new ability just for this agent, you can do this by clicking the 
            plus button. Normally you would choose an existing ability and drag it from the item sidebar.
            You can open the abilities with the pen icon and delete it with the trash icon.
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="six columns">
              <p>
              Next row contains a place to record the agent's Fortune, and next to this a place to
              drag the agent's Focus and Occupation(s).
              </p>
              <p>
              Each of these entries can be expanded to see the description and the associated
              abilities. Any ability the agent already has will show as ticked off.

            On the left is a place to record if the agent has any armour or defence.
            It starts blank (no armour) but can be increased by clicking the up arrow.
          </p>
          <p>
            All other mundane items will appear in the list to the right, when dragged
            onto the character sheet. You can also create a new item by clicking on the plus
            sign.

            <img src="./images/affiliations.png" />
          </p>
          <p>This tab is where the agent's associations with any organisation
            can be dragged onto the sheet. As with occupations and foci, affiliations
            can be clicked on to expand and see the description and any associated abilities
            for that affiliation.

          </p>
          <p>This tab is where the agent's unravelling die is set. As with other resources,
            it can be decreased by clicking the down arrow, and clicked on to roll for unravelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next to this are any angelic Favours the agent has (which can be dragged onto the sheet) and
            any items that the agent possesses that were marked as esoteric.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/unravel.png" />
          </p>
          <p>When the unravelling die is rolled, and the agent falters, a button is presented to roll for the consequences of
            unravelling. Any lingering consequence that may occur from that will appear in the chat card,
            and it should be dragged onto the agent's sheet.
          </p>

          Here you can record the potency of the enemy. A negative number indicates a step-down die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below this is the enemy's Hits, and their Resistance die. These work in the same way as for agents.

          This is the Resolution table to use when an agent is fighting the enemy. Create the resolution table
          as a separate RollTable in Foundry, and drag it onto this sheet here. It will automatically get used
          when an agent falters in a challenge to attack or defend against this enemy.

          based on their Token Disposition. Make sure you set the default token disposition to be Friendly for agents, 
          and Hostile for enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click on the dice icon to roll initiative by Taking a Challenge, which will determine whether the agents

          <img src="./images/falter.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If an agent falters in a challenge, this will be indicated in the chat window for the dice results. Two buttons
          will then be presented. The player should click the button to indicate whether this was a falter in an
          attacking or a defending move.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="./images/roll.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When clicking one of those buttons, a roll on the enemy's resolution table will then happen, and indicate 
          any lingering consequences that might apply.

        <h2 id="items" class="docs-header">Items & Abilities</h2>
        <p>
          When the compendia have been loaded, you will see folders for the following Foundry Items:
        </p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Abilities</h4>
          <p>
            These are the collection of abilities that are referenced by the various associations, occupations and foci an agent may have.
          </p>
          <p>They may give inspiration for role-playing, but in Foundry terms they are simply descriptive text items you can drag onto your sheet.</p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Associations</h4>
          <p>These are the various societies, brotherhoods and affiliations an agent may be associated with. They have a text description and a collection of
            associated abilities.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/association-sheet-1.png" /><img src="./images/association-sheet-2.png" />
          </p>
          <p>If you are creating your own associations, simply drag any abilities onto the sheet.</p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Clothing</h4>
          <p>This is a collection of Mundane possessions of clothing.</p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Consequences</h4>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/consequence.png" />
          </p>
          <p>These are things describing lingering consequences, and describe which resource they affect, and the potency of its effect.</p>
          <p>They are referenced in the various Unravelling table entries and can be used with your own RollTables.</p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Favours</h4>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/favours.png" />
          </p>
          <p>This is the set of angelic magic that might be bestowed upon an agent.</p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Foci</h4>
          <p>Like associations, a focus gives a description, and a collection of abilities associated with it.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/focus-sheet-1.png" /><img src="./images/focus-sheet-2.png" />
          </p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Occupations</h4>
          <p>Similarly, occupations also give a description and the collection of associated abilities.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/occupation-sheet-1.png" /><img src="./images/occupation-sheet-2.png" />
          </p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Odds and Ends</h4>
          <p>These are the collection of possessions that don't fit into any other category. Remember to use the Esoteric tickbox to 
            indicate if an item is magical. This will then ensure it appears under the Esoterica tab of the agent's sheet.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/odds-and-ends.png" />
          </p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Printed Matter</h4>
          <p>These are the things of a literary, legal or otherwise written form.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/printed-matter.png" />
          </p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Tools</h4>
          <p>The collection of useful tools an agent might have.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/tools.png" />
          </p>
          <h4 class="docs-header">Weapons</h4>
          <p>And finally, the set of weapons.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/weapons.png" />
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="docs-section">
        <h2 id="tables" class="docs-header">Tables</h2>
        <p>Foundry is very good at enabling you to create custom rolltables. You can make a rolltable from a folder, such as one of those above,
          by right clicking on the folder, and selecting "Create Rollable Table".
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="./images/create-table.png" /><img src="./images/table-item.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This way you can very easily create a random assignment of possessions, associations and occupations, etc. When rolled on, the random item
          will be displayed in the chat window, and can be dragged onto character sheet from there.
        </p>
        <p>Several tables are preloaded.The <em>Default Resolution Table</em> can be dragged onto an enemy sheet, for use in combat, or you can
        design your own, and drag that on instead.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="./images/default-consequences.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The other tables provided are for the <em>Unravelling</em>. The Unravelling Table is used when you roll for unravelling on your
        sheet and falter. The button in the chat window then uses this table to determine the results of both the immediate and linger consequences.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="./images/unravelling-table.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are also rolltables for each of the humours. Depending on which humour is rolled on the unravelling table, the appropriate <em>Humour</em> 
          table will also be rolled for the lingering consequence. This will be displayed in the chat window and should be dragged onto the agent's sheet.</p>
