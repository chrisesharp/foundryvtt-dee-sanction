  description: "<p>The mob is a bustling, frantic gathering of enemies. Half the time it&rsquo;s milling around considering whether to run away or not. The rest of the time it&rsquo;s poking with pitchforks, jostling and shoving. Overwhelm means the Mob can cause damage even if the Agents don&rsquo;t miss a beat. An average Agent would struggle to handle a Mob without assistance or good fortune.</p>"
